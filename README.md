# VecLSTM
This folder contains all the necessary implementations to replicate the studies presented at ICDM 2024, the world's premier research conference in Data Mining.
# Dataset
The GeoLife dataset, encompassing GPS trajectories from 182 users over three years, offers a comprehensive view of outdoor activities. We utilized the Geolife GPS trajectory dataset, containing 1,467,652 samples with 7 distinct labels. The neural network architecture, designed for this dataset, incorporated LSTM layers followed by a Dense layer, boasting a total of 71,357 trainable parameters.

 Performed several steps to preprocess trajectory data, train an LSTM model, and compare the performance with and without vectorization.
 Performed several steps to preprocess trajectory data, train an Hybrid model, and compare the performance with and without vectorization.
 Compared the training times with and without vectorization.
 Retrieved and displayed the vectorized data from the database.

 This entire process demonstrates the steps taken to preprocess data, apply machine learning models, handle data storage and retrieval in a database, and compare the efficiency of different approaches.
