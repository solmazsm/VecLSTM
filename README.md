# VecLSTM
This folder contains all the necessary implementation to replicate studies presented on ECML PKDD 2024.
# Dataset
The GeoLife dataset, encompassing GPS trajectories from 182 users over three years, offers a comprehensive view of outdoor activities. We utilized the Geolife GPS trajectory dataset, containing 1,467,652 samples with 7 distinct labels. The neural network architecture, designed for this dataset, incorporated LSTM layers followed by a Dense layer, boasting a total of 71,357 trainable parameters.
